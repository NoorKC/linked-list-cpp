# Linked List in C++

This project contains a C++ implementation of a singly linked list with the following features:

- Insert at end
- Display contents
- Reverse nodes in k-groups
- Detect loops (using Floydâ€™s cycle-finding algorithm)
- Reorder nodes by odd/even positions

Made with love (and some effort) by Eknoor, Alina, Zainub, Sevinc
